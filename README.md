[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/kronostechnologies/graphql-generator/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/kronostechnologies/graphql-generator?branch=master)

Converts a GraphQL Schema to static PHP files. It currently supports generating class files per type in the PSR-4 standard. The tool is interfaced through a CLI.

## Requirements

- **PHP 5.6** or higher.
- Composer


## Installation

As this is currently in development, you can clone this repository and try out the CLI tool with composer.

```
git clone https://github.com/kronostechnologies/graphql-generator.git
composer install
```


## Testing

Run unit tests with PHPUnit 5.7.

```
phpunit
```


## Usage

You can run the CLI tool with the following command:

```
php graphqlgen --help
```


### Classes generator

```
  php graphqlgen generate-classes [options] [--] <input> <targetdir>
```

Arguments are:
* _input_: A .graphqls file to use as input.
* _targetdir_: A directory in which to generate the classes.

Available options are:
* `--writer=WRITER`: Type of writer with which to output the files. Default is psr4.
    * PSR4 Writer: A class will be generated for each type definition under `Types\Enums` for enum types, `Types\Interfaces` for interface types, `Types\Scalars` for scalar types, and `Types` for standard types. The PSR-4 standard will be respected.
* `--psr4-namespace`: If using the PSR4 Writer, the given namespace will be prefixed. This does not alter the target directory structure.
* `--stubs-dir`: This is a directory containing the stub files for generating files. For the PSR4 Writer, the files required are the same ones in [src/Generator/Writer/PSR4/stubs](./src/Generator/Writer/PSR4/stubs)
* `--overwrite`: If this flag is set, the writer will attempt to override the files. If not, a warning will be thrown when an existing file is found.
* `--formatter-use-tabs`: If this flag is set, the PHP ouput file formatter will use tabs instead of spaces for indentation.
* `--formatter-indent-spaces`: If not using tabs for the formatter, this is the number of spaces per indent block. Default is 4.
* `--formatter-line-merge`: When descriptions are written on multiple lines in a .graphqls file, they are merged with the specified character. Default is `,`.

### Stub Files

For the default mode (PSR4), the stub files are used as a boilerplate for generating the files of a specific GraphQL type. For example, an interface type will use `interface.stub` as its base file for generating the class. The following types are matched:

* Enums: `enum.stub`
* Interfaces: `interface.stub`
* Object: `object.stub`
* Scalar: `scalar.stub`

See [src/Generator/Writer/PSR4/stubs](./src/Generator/Writer/PSR4/stubs) for the stub files content.

### TypeStore

The TypeStore is generated by the PSR4Writer to act as a singleton for type definitions. It is important that the definition of a type exists only once in the whole instance, due to the inner workings of the PHP GraphQL library. Its boilerplate can be found in [src/Generator/Writer/PSR4/stubs/typestore.stub](./src/Generator/Writer/PSR4/stubs/typestore.stub) and be modified like all other stubs.


## Examples

The [examples](./examples) source directory contains some graphqls schema examples on which you can run the tool against.

### Simple schema generation

To generate class files from a valid graphqls file, run the following command:

```
php graphqlgen generate-classes ./examples/base.graphqls ./base
```

The output files will appear in the `base` directory.


### Using different StubFiles

```
php graphqlgen generate-classes --stubs-dir=./examples/psr4-stubs ./examples/base.graphqls ./base
```

Specifying the PSR4 Stubs Path allows changing the templates used by the generator.


## Mutations

Mutations are currently ignored when generating the GraphQL files. As these mostly imply logical operations, you will need to implement the resolve functions yourself.
